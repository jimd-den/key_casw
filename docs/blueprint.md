# **App Name**: Key Case

## Core Features:

- Key-Based Account Management: Allow users to create an account using a unique digital key pair and log in by proving they control the private key. Store the public key for identification, but the private key stays with the user.
- Mystery Case Creation: Enable authors to create new mystery cases, add a title, description, difficulty, upload evidence files (pictures, documents, audio), and add text notes for each piece of evidence. Authors need to mark suspects and victims, specify the correct solution, and publish their cases.
- Mystery Solving Interface: Allow detectives to view a list of available mysteries, select a mystery, and see all evidence. Provide a place to type notes, submit their guess for the crime, and receive a message if their solution is correct.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A clean white or light grey for a modern, uncluttered feel.
- Secondary color: Dark grey or black for text and important UI elements to ensure readability.
- Accent: A deep blue (#3F51B5) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions, evoking a sense of trust and authority.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for all text elements.
- Simple, outlined icons for navigation and key features.
- Mobile-first, responsive layout using Bootstrap's grid system.
